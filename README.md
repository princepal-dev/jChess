# ♟️ Java Chess Engine (GUI-Based)

A fully object-oriented **Chess Game with a Graphical User Interface**, implemented in **Java** using modern software design principles and clean architecture.  
This project demonstrates advanced Java concepts such as **abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism**, and the use of **design patterns** to simulate and visualize a playable chessboard.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a **GUI-based Chess Engine built from scratch** in Java.  
It models all chess components — pieces, tiles, moves, and players — using a clean and extensible OOP architecture, while integrating a responsive graphical interface that allows players to interact with the board intuitively.

The GUI layer is built using **Java Swing** (depending on what you used — update below), rendering each piece and board tile dynamically based on the underlying game logic.

## 🧩 Features

- ♜ **Graphical User Interface** — Fully interactive chessboard with clickable pieces and tiles.
- ♞ **OOP-Based Architecture** — Abstract classes and inheritance to model tiles and pieces.
- ♝ **Piece Logic** — Each chess piece encapsulates its own movement and validation logic.
- ♟️ **Tile System** — Efficient handling of empty and occupied tiles via an abstract `Tile` class.
- ♛ **Move Validation** — Detects legal and illegal moves according to chess rules.
- ♚ **Real-Time Updates** — Board refreshes dynamically after every valid move.
- ⚙️ **Design Patterns Used**
    - *Factory Pattern* → For creating tiles and pieces.
    - *Strategy Pattern* → For defining movement behaviors.
    - *Observer Pattern* → For GUI updates when the board state changes.
