# ♟️ Java Chess Engine

A fully object-oriented **Chess Engine implemented in Java**, following modern software design principles and clean architecture.  
This project demonstrates advanced Java concepts such as **abstraction, immutability, encapsulation, polymorphism**, and the use of **design patterns** to simulate a real chessboard environment.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a from-scratch implementation of a **console-based chess engine**, inspired by object-oriented design tutorials.  
It aims to represent the chessboard, pieces, and movement logic using a clean and extensible architecture — preparing the foundation for both a playable GUI and future AI integration.
